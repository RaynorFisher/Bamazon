##Intro
This is a command line app that uses node to interact with our custom databases in MySQL. With Halloween coming up I thought I would try to add a spooky theme to this assigment in the form of a scary apothecary run by Hagatha the Witch. 

### Errors
1. I have been unable to link the database to the node Javascript, I have troubleshooted and used many different possible solutions but I think my MySQL workbench setup is at fault somehow. 

I saw this error the most in my troubleshooting:

2. I think that my Database was setup correctly and I also think my intitial workbench setup was solid.

3. The data was imported successfully to the table and in the correct format with the columns.

## JS

1. I tried all kinds of ways to try and link with the MySql database, changing the host, username, passwords, and a few other was but still couldn't link it properly. 

2. I attempted to lay out some Javascript for the rest of the app but I had some problems which I pointed out in my code comments.
